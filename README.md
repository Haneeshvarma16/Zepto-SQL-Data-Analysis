# Zepto SQL Analysis

## About

This is a simple SQL project where I analyzed a Zepto-style grocery dataset using PostgreSQL.
The project focuses on cleaning the data and finding useful business insights from it.

## Tools Used

* SQL

## What I Did

* Created a table to store product details like category, price, discount, quantity, and stock status.
* Cleaned the data by removing invalid prices and handling missing values.
* Converted prices from paise to rupees for correct calculations.
* Analyzed the dataset to answer business questions.

## Key Analysis

* Found top products with the highest discounts.
* Identified expensive products that are out of stock.
* Calculated estimated revenue for each category.
* Compared products based on price per gram to find best value.
* Grouped products into Low, Medium, and Bulk based on weight.
* Measured total inventory weight per category.

## Learning Outcome

This project helped me practice real-world SQL, data cleaning, and business analysis using queries.
